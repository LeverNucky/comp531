1.I hope to learn how to build a userful website and I think I know how to do it now

2.I enjoy creating a web application from scratch. It feels like I really accomplish something huge.

3.The course workload is fair imo

4.I think the gap between learning Redux and finishing HW4 is kind of big. I hope we can add some simple exercises
to learn Redux first and then face the problem like we did in HW4

5. Demits seems unfair in most of the assignments. It really sucks if you spent so much like and got 50 pts only because some demits. I mean we need to get punished by not following the instructions. However, the penalty seems
too huge for me.
