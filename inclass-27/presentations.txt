1.Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?

I think Jiawei Wu's Native vs Web presentation impressed me a lot. First of all, he used online web page as a presentation media which was unique. Secondly, he had cool and clean presentation pages. Last but not least, he made really clear distinctions between native pages and web pages.

2.Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?

I learned a lot from Sishan's Online Ads vs AdBlock presentation.
Canvas fingerprinting and evercookies are some techs that I never heard about.
He also gave equations about how to calcualte ad price which seems interesting.

3.Which talk did you like the best and why?

I like a lot from Haoyuan Xia's Apache vs Nginx. presentation. His oral expression was pretty outstanding. He also
had a deep comparison between apache and nginx which inspired me a lot.
